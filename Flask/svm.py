    We use the Support Vector Machine (with k-nearest neighbour) algorithm to determine the class of each chat message.
    We work with our data_list containing all stemmed and processed utterances and our lexicon without occurence probabilities.

    First we need to estimate the vectors for each utterance of the training set.
    The values of the vector are the number of times each word of our lexicon appears in our utterance.
    Then we compare for each utterance its vector with all other vectors to find the ones most similar.
    To do this, we need to estimate the normalized dot product.

    The class of our tweet is estimated by the (intellectually assigned) class of the k tweets with the most similar vector
    (k=5, which got the better results).
